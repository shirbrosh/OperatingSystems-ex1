Assignment 1:
    By running the program WhatIDo with the linux command strace, we understood that the program
    opens a new folder under the name "Welcome" and within this folder opens another new folder
    under the name "To", within this folder the programs creates a new file called "OS2020" and
    then writes within the file the login of the user, and in a new line adds the sentence "If you
    haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!" and in another new line it writes
    the argument given to the program. At the end of the program the file is closed and then removed
    and both folders are removed as well.

Assignment 2:
    In this section we measured the run time of different operations inside the VM, container and
    the cs computers. The measures we received:
        on the linux computer: addition - 0.43 [ns]
                               empty function - 1.69 [ns]
                               trap - 400.15 [ns]
        inside the container: addition - 0.43 [ns]
                       empty function - 1.64 [ns]
                       trap - 400.92 [ns]
        inside the VM: addition - 5.61 [ns]
                              empty function - 27.27 [ns]
                              trap - 676 [ns]
    The graph we plotted measures the operation run-time in logarithmic scale.
